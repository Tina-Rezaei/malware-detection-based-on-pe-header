# malware-detection-based-on-pe-header

Implementation of "An Efficient Approach For Malware Detection Using PE Header Specification."

# RUN
feature_extraction.py extracts all features discribed in the paper and stores them in the specified output file. You need to run it for your malware samples and benign samples separately.
```
python feature_extraction.py --path path_of_samples --outputfile path_of_output_file_for_extracted_features

```

After that, you need to run main.py. It takes the path of extracted features for malware and benign samples.

```
python main.py --malware_features_path path_of_extracted_features_for_malware_samples --benign_features_path path_of_extracted_features_for_benign_samples

```

# Example

```
python feature_extraction.py --path path_of_malware_samples --outputfile malware_features.txt
python feature_extraction.py --path path_of_benign_samples --outputfile benign_features.txt
python main.py --malware_features_path malware_features.txt --benign_features_path benign_features.txt
```
